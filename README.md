## Project_1
**Project Type**: Simple Linear Regression problem
### Purpose
- Explore the relationship between Life Satisfaction and GDP per capita;
- Answer the question *Did the life satisfaction of people living in European countries in 2017 depend on the country's GPD?*
### Utilized Regression Analysis tools
- Detecting outliers;
- Calculating a correlation coefficient;
- Checking assumptions about the data (normality, linearity, independence);
- Hypothesis testing.

## Project_2
**Project Type**: Multiple Linear Regression problem
### Purpose
- Analyze what factors influence the level of satisfaction of people living in developing countries;
- Answer the question *What did affect the Life Satisfaction rate of people from developing countries in 2016?*
### Utilized Regression Analysis tools
- Detecting outliers (Boxplots, Cook's D chart);
- Bulding a correlation matrix;
- Feature selection (F-tests, VIF, $R_a^2, Mallow's $C_p$, BIC);
- Building Added-Variable plots;
- Checking assumptions about the data (normality, linearity, independence);
- Hypothesis testing.
